# Commit Message Emoji 👋

Every commit is important.
So let's celebrate each and every commit with a corresponding emoji! 😄

Oh, and it can also help with glancing over commit messages to figure out
what kind of changes have been made. 😏

## Usage

Prepend every commit message with an emoji with this form:
`<emoji> commit message`.

For commits with multiple types of messages, use multiple lines:
```
<emoji> commit message
<emoji2> commit message2
```

## Which Emoji to Use? ❓
